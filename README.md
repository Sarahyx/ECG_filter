# Introduction

I'd like to write a step by step introduction about how to build up a simple FIR filter to process ECG signals. The aim for this project is to help me review the DSP knowledge I have learned before and have a practise in Python.

# ECG signals

## What is ECG signals

ECG is the abbreviation of electrocardiograph. For healthy person, their heart rate is about 60-100 beats per minutes. In addition, ECG has 4 peaks which are PQRST showing below.

先写个框架，回头填坑。

## What we need to do to filter ECG signals

# FIR filter design

## What is FIR filter

## How to design h(n)

## Why we need window function

## How to improve precision

# FIR filter Implementation

## Ring buffer

## Unit test

## Remove 50Hz and DC interference

## Improvement

## Heart rate detection

### Another way to reduce DC and other interference

### Remove wrong detections

## Link with database online
